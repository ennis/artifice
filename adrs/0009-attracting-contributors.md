# 8. Attracting users and contributors

Date: 2020-06-07

## Status

Draft

## Context

There are a few rust GUI libraries out there, and it seems that most of the advanced ones (`druid`, `iced`, etc.) 
have more than one contributor. 
Currently, `kyute` is not designed to be a general-purpose library (or at least I try not to): it is primarily shaped 
by the requirements of `artifice` (which are currently unclear...).

Even so (or maybe _because of that_), it might have features that makes it attractive for some applications. 
So there is the possibility that other people might be interested to use it, or even contribute to it, should it be 
made public. Even if people choose to not use it, it might be useful for other GUI libs as a comparison reference.

Currently there are a few hurdles for people using it and contributing to it:
- the repo is not public
- the documentation is poor
- it's windows-only (D2D drawing)
