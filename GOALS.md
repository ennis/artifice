Artifice: a code base for graphics experiments with GPU.

Current pain points when trying stuff with GPU:
- write from scratch: lots of boilerplate code
- use an engine: need to learn to use it, and constrained to what the engine provides
	- plugins? need to learn the plug-in API or rather reverse-enginner it sometimes due to poor documentation
- use an helper (API-agnostic) library: constrained to the concepts that the library provides, can't use "exotic" GPU features that are not wrapped

Also:
- interactivity/tweakability is key
